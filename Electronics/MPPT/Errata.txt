============================================================
1. Incorrect Annotation on Diodes for Array Voltage Sensor

Summary:
D5 and D6 refer to the correct footprints but are incorrectly annotated; D5 should be annotated "zener" while D6 should be annotated "ordinary".

Corrective Action:
  a. Cover silkscreen annotation with a new label with the
     correct annotation.
  b. Keep a note in the assembly instructions to be careful
     with these components.

Explanation:
Many of our components have a pair of diodes for over- and under-voltage protection: one zener, one general purpose. To help in assembly, they are labeled "zener" and "ordinary", respectively. However, in moving and rotating the diodes for the Solar Array's voltage sensors, I accidentally swapped these labels, and this was not caught before production.

2. Incorrect Footprints on Regulator Capacitors

Summary:
C4, C5, and C24 are sized 0805, but the only available capacitors in their recommended capacitances are size 1206 or 1210.

Corrective Action:
  a. Find smaller capacitance capacitors to use in place of
     originally specified capacitances.
  b. Attempt to solder on components onto the smaller pads.
     There may be just enough room.
  c. Jerry-rig larger capacitors with leads onto the pads.
     This would be very precarious, and may not hold up to
     vibrations in the car. This is a last-ditch option.

Explanation:
During PCB design, I had assumed we would be able to find all of our capacitors in size 0805, and having run into a time-crunch didn't double-check that that was the case. As it turns out, we can't find SMD 100uF capacitors in sizes smaller than 1210 or SMD 47uF capacitors in sizes smaller than 1206. The 1206 is just small enough to be soldered into the 0805, and while the 1210 has the same length, it's far wider. This could make populating the board difficult.

Lesson learned. Always double-check footprints before ordering.

3. Missing Protection Diodes on Current Sensor Outputs

Summary:
The voltage sensor outputs and the FET driver inputs have diodes to protect the Nucleo against voltage spikes; the current sensors lack these on their outputs.

Corrective Action:
  - None; it should be safe enough.

Explanation:
During schematic design, I hadn't yet realized the purpose of the diodes, so when I replaced the old current sensors with our new ones, I didn't keep them. I didn't realize their purpose until I was picking diode parts after the PCB had been ordered. The design of the sensor has enough headroom that the Nucleo should be safe, but in future revisions the protection diodes should be reinserted.

4. Oversized RC Filter Capacitors on Voltage Sensors

Summary:
The footprints for the voltage sensor RC filters are 1206 rather than 0805. Appropriate capacitors can still be found in that size, but most of the rest of our capacitors are 0805.

Corrective Action:
  - None; no effect on performance.

Explanation:
Simple mistake I didn't notice before production.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. Mechanical PCB-Lock Holes Have Pads

Summary:
The non-plated through-holes for the Phoenix and Molex connectors have pads surrounding them; they should not.

Corrective Action:
  - None; no hazard or liability.

Explanation:
Simple mistake during footprint design that wasn't worth the time to fix before production. Because the PCB-lock devices on the connectors are plastic and the pads themselves are not connected to any electrical trace or plane, there is no hazard or liability induced by this mistake.
